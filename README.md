# Production of multistrange particles at LHC from the ALICE experiment

Multistrange particles, Ξ- and Ω-, are very sensitive probes of the overall level of strangeness in a proton-proton collision [1,2]. It was proposed by J.D. Bjorken that in a proton-proton collision of sufficiently high multiplicity (number of particles produced in a collision) a Quark- Gluon Plasma (QGP) might be formed [3], but, till now, such very high multiplicity collisions have not been accessible. The LHC provides a new regime where much higher multiplicity collisions are seen to occur. Should a QGP be created, a thermal system is produced in which strangeness abundances could be much higher than in normal hadronic reactions [4], as has already been seen in heavy ion interactions. In this project, the relative production rates for multistrange particles will be examined as a function of multiplicity to look for possible changes from the values expected for hadronic interactions.

This project gives students practical experience of some of the methods, techniques and tools used in high-energy physics data analysis, as well as providing insight into state-of-the-art detector systems and the physics of the strong interaction. This project primarily involves analysing existing data and hence is a computing based project. The project will make use of software tools that have been developed by the ALICE collaboration and build on the ROOT C++ analysis framework. You will be provided with a working program for your analysis task but will have to make changes to it. Hence, you need to enjoy programming and thinking of ways to check that your code works the way you think it should.
